## Question 2: Case-Based Sentence Encryption

Your task is to encrypt the message with a certain number of words according to the following conditions:

1. If the word is in the **even position** (starting counting from 0), convert to **UPPERCASE**; otherwise, convert to **lowercase**.
2. **Reverse** characters in each word.

The input is a number of words in a sentence and the sentence itself. The output is an encrypted sentence.
