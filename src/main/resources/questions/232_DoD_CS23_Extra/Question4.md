## Question 4: Adjacent Element Swapping

Write a program to swap the adjacent elements as the following conditions:

1. If the size of the given element list is even, then swap each pair of adjacent elements.
2. If the size of the given element list is odd, then swap each pair of adjacent elements except the last element.

**Example:**
If the input list is `1 2 3 0`, the output is `2 1 0 3`.

### Example:

| **Input** | **Result** |
| --- | --- |
| 5 <br> 5 1 4 2 8 | 1 5 2 4 8 |
| 4 <br> 1 2 3 0 | 2 1 0 3 |
