The blacksmith will try to complete a whole set of equipment first. If there’re any ingots left, the blacksmith will prioritize making a sword, a shield and then a helmet respectively. Your task is to write a program that takes the amount of iron ingots and calculates how many pieces of each type of weapon can be made and how many ingots are left.

The input is the amount of iron ingots. The outputs are number of swords, shields, helmets and remaining ingots respectively.

|:--------------|:-----------|
|25| 1 1 2 1|
|49|2 2 4 1|
|50|2 3 2 0|
|2578|123 122 124 0|
|112456|5355 5355 5355 1|
|4546|217 216 216 0|
